### Future Plans

* I want to study and work in both environmental science and public health
  + One Health is the paradigm, baby
  + Community-based intersectional environmental work of all kinds is probably the way so let's try it at scale and find out

### Current Research

* The impact COVID-19 has had on self-provisioning through:
  + gardening
  + foraging
  + backyard poultry
  + hunting
  + fishing

### Things about Jeanne

* I'm from the Midwest
  + Southwestern Wisconsin is not flat, it is driftless!
  + Yes I like cheese
  
* I'm a partner and a parent
  + My son is two years old and loves to play in water, mud, sand, rocks, leaves, and dirt
  + My partner and I got to know each other in Morocco over 10 years ago
